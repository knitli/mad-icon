## Implementing New Features or Refactoring Based on a Plan

1. **Understand the Refactoring or Implementation Plan:**
   - Familiarize yourself with the refactoring plan, including the purpose of each phase and the specific changes to be made.
   - Identify the files and functions that will be affected by the refactoring.
   - Look for existing code or modules that can be reused or modified to fit the new structure.
   - Understand the data flow and how the new features will interact with existing components.
   - Identify any dependencies or interactions with other parts of the codebase that may be affected by the changes.

2. **Implement the Changes:**
    - Follow the plan step by step, making changes to the codebase as outlined.
    - Ensure that you are using the correct coding standards and conventions for the project.
    - **IGNORE ALL LINTING ERRORS, ISSUES OR PROBLEMS (e.g. pylance) UNTIL YOU ARE DONE WITH THE REFRACTORING OR FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION.**
        - If you encounter any issues or errors during the implementation, document them and address them later.
        - Focus on completing the coding plan first.
        - Your goal is to get the plan implemented, and then you can go back and fix any linting issues or errors. Most of these will have been generated by the implementation itself (e.g. dead code, not yet implemented code, or no longer used dependencies).

3. **Before Finishing the Task**:
    - Review the changes you have made to ensure they align with the plan.
    - Ask the user if they are satisfied with the changes and if they would like to make any adjustments.
